# Procedural Fairings

**Procedural Fairings** is a mod for **Kerbal Space Program (KSP)** that creates fairings that can automatically reshape for any attached payload.

**[Original KSP forum thread][PF:original-forum-link]**

## Installation

Extract the contents of the ProceduralFairings.zip and then drop the ProceduralFairings folder into the GameData folder. **Note:** if you are upgrading then make sure that any previous Procedural Fairings installation has been completely removed beforehand.

### Usage

1. Put a fairing base under your payload (all Procedural Fairings parts are in the Payload tab) and a decoupler if necessary.
2. Attached fairings automatically reshape for your payload.
3. Enabling symmetry on fairings will encapsulate your payload
4. Rearrange stages to jettison fairings at the proper stage.

### Notes

* All part tweakables are accessible via the right-click part action windows (diameter, length, shape etc).
* Flipping another fairing base over and adding it above the payload will cause any side fairings to stick to it instead of creating a nose cone, thereby creating inline fairings between two bases.
* Procedural Fairings includes low-profile base rings intended for inline fairings. Separate interstage bases are also included.
* Procedural Fairings are fully integrated with the career mode. The minimum and maximum part sizes are limited by the available tech (see "ProceduralFairings_Settings.cfg" for more details).
